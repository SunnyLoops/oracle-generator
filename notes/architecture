## Oracle Images Organization

The `oracle-images/` folder contains all image assets used in this project. Currently, images are organized in the following folder:

- **cards/**  
  Contains all oracle card images.

### Notes

- Each image file is approximately 150 KB.
- Total number of images is 44.
- This structure helps maintain clarity and simplifies asset management.
- System files like `.DS_Store` are excluded via `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean.

---

As the project grows, this structure may be expanded with additional folders.
## Oracle Generator Architecture

### Image-Description Matching

- The project contains **44 oracle card images** stored in the `oracle-images/cards/` folder.
- Each image has a corresponding **description** stored in the `descriptions/` folder.
- Descriptions and images follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `card01.png` matches `descriptions01.md`).
- During generation, a **random image-description pair** is selected to create a unique oracle card output.
- This ensures coherent pairing and easy scalability when new cards are added.

### Future Considerations

- Implement validation to ensure every image has a matching description.
- Explore support for additional metadata (e.g., keywords or categories).
### Image-Description Mapping via JSON

- A JSON file named `image-description-map.json` will reside in the `src/` folder.
- This file maps each oracle image filename to its corresponding description filename.
- Example structure:

  ```json
  {
    "Abundance_oracle.png": "Abundance_description.md",
    "Growth_oracle.png": "Growth_description.md",
    ...
  }### Random Oracle Generation

- The system selects a random image filename from the `oracle-images/cards/` folder.
- It then uses the `image-description-map.json` to find the matching description file.
- This pairing is displayed or returned as the generated oracle card.
Images and descriptions are randomly selected as pairs, ensuring each description matches its corresponding image.
